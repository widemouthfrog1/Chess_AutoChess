# Chess_AutoChess
I am making an Auto Chess style game using the chess pieces and board. I am going to document my progress as I first make chess and then Auto Chess.

I already started this project earlier, however I wanted my progress documented so employers can see my thought process. Hence, I already made the images I need earlier. The first few issues and commits will be me roughly repeating what I did.
